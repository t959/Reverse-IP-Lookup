# Reverse-IP-Lookup
The Reverse Lookup tool will do a reverse IP lookup. If you type in an IP address, we will attempt to locate a dns PTR record for that IP address. You can then click on the results to find out more about that IP Address. Please note that in general, your ISP must setup and maintain these Reverse DNS records (i.e. PTR records) for you.
